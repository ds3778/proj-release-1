# Quasar App (proj-Release-4)

In this release, I have added Login Page which has two buttons -Authenticate and
Not Authentic. When clicking on Authentic button, user will be autneticated to access /user api of Github and will see the plan object in response. When unauthenticated, user will get a 401 response.

I have already integerated Gists with github through backend service and table shows Gists in my repo in MyGists page.
