# Quasar App (proj-Release-4)

In this release, I have added Login Page which has two buttons -Authenticate and
Not Authentic. When clicking on Authentic button, user will be autneticated to access /users/ds3778 api of Github and will see the plan object in response. When unauthenticated, user will not see plan response.

Authentication is a very key factor in protecting REST services. Whenever we need to protect our data, authentication is required so that only allowed users can view the data. Along with this, authorization also plays a very important role. Not all allowed users may have the right to view data - we may need to authorize the user based on their roles to view data.

I have already integerated Gists with github through backend service and table shows Gists in my repo in MyGists page.
